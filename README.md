# Game of life
This was a test project to introduce me to C# WPF.
You can found a built copy of the app [here](https://github.com/exel80/GameOfLife/releases/tag/1.0)

# Game rules:
 ##### For a space that is populated
 - Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
 - Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
 - Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
 ##### For a space that is empty or unpopulated
 - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
